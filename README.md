# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
We have been asked by PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019.

We started off by creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using the knowledge of Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After the completion of the analysis, we were asked to provide a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
